I am a curious person that gets paid to work on software.

In my career I have worked on cloud infrastructure, satellite communication, digital writing, and now geospatial data processing. 
Currently I work at Microsoft.

In my spare time I maintain a [recipe management](https://letscooktime.com/) website with some neat features.
