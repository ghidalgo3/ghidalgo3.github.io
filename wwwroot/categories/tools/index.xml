      <description>VSCode supports starting and debugging processes though its launch configuration system. Launch configurations control what happens when you press F5, and for simple scenarios there are several templates that get the job done. Multiple times now I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in situations where pressing F5 fails because the process being debugged depends on an external service like a database. It&amp;rsquo;s trivial to start a database service, but the lost time and focus from such a failure usually derails my motivation.</description>

      <title>Hello LLDB</title>

      <description>Introduction I am reading through Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystom and one of the first exercises asks you to write and debug a doubly-linked list in C. Regretfully I confess I never actually learned how to use GDB, ever, and on macOS I need to use the LLVM toolchain which means using LLDB instead of GDB. In this post I will write using LLDB to debug a simple C program.</description>

      <description>Introduction My latent ADHD is manifesting as an intolerance for the slowness of the .NET inner loop, specially when reality is more like:
Write some C# (fun) Build (not fun, MSBuild is üê¢) Run (kinda fun, but in reality this means getting your program to the right state which is repetitive and loses novelty after the first run) Debug (Bash your head onto your keyboard until you understand what&amp;rsquo;s wrong) Enlightenment üî• Go to 1 To soothe myself, I will explore ways to improve it.</description>

      <title>Linux Disk Reference</title>

      <description>Running out of disk space on a system can be much more disruptive than running out of memory or being under high load. Recently at work we experienced a brief outage due to a machine (not a VM!) whose disk filled up with log files, which caused the application writing to disk to crash, which made the machine useless, which led to the outage. The mitigation was to release disk space, start the application, and configure it to limit its disk usage and to clean up logs.</description>

      <description>Contents TOC {:toc} Introduction I have spent the last 2 years working on Azure products that relied heavily on different networking features of various Linux distributions. I found myself really struggling trying to understand how to connect the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; book knowledge of compute networking with the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; of the Linux networking stack. Initially I just blamed my ignorance of Linux tools, but soon my opinion changed from blame to empathy for me and for all other developers who, like me, have read a book or two but have not spent much time hands-on-keyboard trying to configure a network.</description>

      <title>Fun with jq</title>

      <description>What is jq? jq is a wonderful tool for processing JSON in the command line. The prevalence of JSON in web APIs and data dumps makes jq a very imporant tool for interactively manipulating JSON. The tutorial is good enough to get you started with basic functionality, but I found that real usage quickly outgrew the scope of the tutorial. In this post I will show examples of using jq in slightly more complex scenarios than the tutorial.</description>
