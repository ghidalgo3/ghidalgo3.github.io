<p>My latent ADHD is manifesting as an intolerance for the slowness of the .NET inner loop, specially when reality is more like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write some C# (fun)</li>
<li>Build (not fun, MSBuild is üê¢)</li>
<li>Run (kinda fun, but in reality this means getting your program to the right state which is repetitive and loses novelty after the first run)</li>
<li>Debug (Bash your head onto your keyboard until you understand what&rsquo;s wrong)</li>
<li>Enlightenment üî•</li>
<li>Go to 1</li>
</ol>
<p>To soothe myself, I will explore ways to improve it.
I will even leave .NET to see what greener pastures are out there.</p>
<p>In my ideal world, programming <em>does</em> involve a REPL. I want to be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start my long running program that waits for I/O (requests, clicks, key strokes, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>Redefine functions in the running program so that the program state in memory isn&rsquo;t lost.</li>
<li>Not have the program restart when a change is maded (at least most of the time, some changes do require a restart)</li>
</ol>
<p>Most hot reload systems have an element of resarting the whole process, which defeats the purpose of it all.</p>

<p>This is pretty good, though the way I have it set up will result in a page reload instead of a diff being applied when I edit my TypeScript React.</p>
<p>It does work for CSS, which makes editing stylesheets quite fun.</p>
<p>I do not know if its possible to make this <em>not</em> reload the page when code is changed.</p>

<p>The list of edits that cause a program restart is quite large: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/wiki/EnC-Supported-Edits.md">https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/wiki/EnC-Supported-Edits.md</a></p>
