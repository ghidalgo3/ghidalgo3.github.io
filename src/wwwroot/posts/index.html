        Slightly complex VSCode launch configurations

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      VSCode supports starting and debugging processes through its launch configuration system, largely configured with the tasks.json and launch.json editor configuration files. Launch configurations control what happens, and in what order, when you press F5 and the green play button in the debug pane. As a project grows in scope and in team members, I have learned that it is easier to tell other developers &ldquo;just press F5 and everything will just work&rdquo; rather than asking them to read README files.

      Introduction I am reading through Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystom and one of the first exercises asks you to write and debug a doubly-linked list in C. Regretfully I confess I never actually learned how to use GDB, ever, and on macOS I need to use the LLVM toolchain which means using LLDB instead of GDB. In this post I will write using LLDB to debug a simple C program.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Running out of disk space on a system can be much more disruptive than running out of memory or being under high load. Recently at work we experienced a brief outage due to a machine (not a VM!) whose disk filled up with log files, which caused the application writing to disk to crash, which made the machine useless, which led to the outage. The mitigation was to release disk space, start the application, and configure it to limit its disk usage and to clean up logs.

      Contents TOC {:toc} Introduction I have spent the last 2 years working on Azure products that relied heavily on different networking features of various Linux distributions. I found myself really struggling trying to understand how to connect the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; book knowledge of compute networking with the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of the Linux networking stack. Initially I just blamed my ignorance of Linux tools, but soon my opinion changed from blame to empathy for me and for all other developers who, like me, have read a book or two but have not spent much time hands-on-keyboard trying to configure a network.

        Rust Day 2: Linked Lists

      Today I was inspired to continue learning Rust by implementing what every CS student eventually has to know backwards and forwards to get a job: a singly linked list. This shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, my list will support:
Appending elements to the list one at a time Iterating over elements Determining the length of the list by iterating from head to tail Deallocating the list Using Rust modules (just to learn how they work) Every linked list needs a good recursive linked_list_node definition with a nice car and cdr erm I mean value and next:

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      What is jq? jq is a wonderful tool for processing JSON in the command line. The prevalence of JSON in web APIs and data dumps makes jq a very imporant tool for interactively manipulating JSON. The tutorial is good enough to get you started with basic functionality, but I found that real usage quickly outgrew the scope of the tutorial. In this post I will show examples of using jq in slightly more complex scenarios than the tutorial.

      Problem At work we write a lot of ASP.NET REST controllers. Some of the controllers have their API documented in the Azure REST API specs in the form of a Swagger specification, and some are consumed internally by a system that requires us to expose a Swagger specification. This is our problem: say we want to write a controller for Widgets that supports CRUD operations. A developer has to:

The problem was that we had no idea which value was incorrectly set, and we were so deep into highly reusable generic code that pushing the value name via method parameter would have required touching dozens of call sites.
To concretize this, we have something like this (types have been altered for their safety):

      I&rsquo;m learning Rust to get my systems programing muscle back into shape after living in C# land for a few years. C# is a very nice language and the tooling ecosystem around it is wonderful, but all the serious systems programming is happening in C/C++ and now Rust. I will try to document my baby steps into Rust for myself and for anyone else that wants to learn Rust after having programmed in C# for a while.
