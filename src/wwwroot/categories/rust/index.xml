      <description>Today I was inspired to continue learning Rust by implementing what every CS student eventually has to know backwards and forwards to get a job: a singly linked list. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard, my list will support:
Appending elements to the list one at a time Iterating over elements Determining the length of the list by iterating from head to tail Deallocating the list Using Rust modules (just to learn how they work) Every linked list needs a good recursive linked_list_node definition with a nice car and cdr erm I mean value and next:</description>

I will try to document my baby steps into Rust for myself and for anyone else that wants to learn Rust after having programmed in C# for a while.</description>
