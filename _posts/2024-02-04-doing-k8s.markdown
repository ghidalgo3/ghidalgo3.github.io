Enough cribbing about tooling, let's run some containers!

# Archetype
At $DAYJOB I maintain a lot of Python code, so to make everything transferrable I'm going to create a Python package called `archetype` which is your archetypical Azure Python REST service.
The only design constraint is that `archetype` must not do anything interesting! 
WYSIWYG, so to speak.
Its source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ghidalgo3/ghidalgo3.github.io/tree/main/k8s), and for my sanity I'll document a little of its structure here:

1. `scripts` directory holds the project scripts according to the [scripts-to-rule-them-all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern.
1. `pyproject.toml` defines metadata for the project. This file is involved when packaging this into a wheel (a python package) and if I was publishing this on PyPI then this file would drive the metadata that others see about this package.
